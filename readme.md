# DataScience_experiments

Some notebooks containing experiments driven by curiosity I have about data. Welcome to my jungle :)

- [Laplacian Regularization](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/x0s/DataScience_experiments/blob/master/Laplacian_Regularization/Laplacian_Regularization.ipynb)
- [Deep dive on Dataclasses (python 3.7)](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/x0s/DataScience_experiments/blob/master/dataclasses/Deep_dive_on_Dataclasses.ipynb)
- [User-defined distribution sampler](https://github.com/x0s/DataScience_experiments/blob/add-custom-distribution-sampler/custom_sampler/Custom_sampling.ipynb)

Github has a [issue](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/452) to properly render LaTeX equations. Therefore, I recommend to follow the links I provide here (nbviewer.ipython.org rendering).
